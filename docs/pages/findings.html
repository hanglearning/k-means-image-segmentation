                <p><span style="color: red">Answer:</span></p> 
                <p>While we were studying this question in the basement of the Morris Library, we believed that the photo which has K=2 as the best must have two strong contrast color in the picture. Basically that means we have to take a photo that only has two base colors in the picture and these two colors should have high constrast.<br><br> We raised our heads and saw this sign on the wall, and we believed this is a great example. Although in this picture it has three base colors - purple as the wall, blue as the background color of the sign, and white text color of the sign, we had the faith that when we run our algorithm using K = 2 with this picture, the text of the sign will still be somehow a light color closer to white while the other color should be a color that's between blue and purple, as compared to white, the euclid distance between blue and purple should be closer, so they will be clustered together, and white color pixels with other ligh color pixels will also be clustered together. We verified our belief with our resulted K = 2 picture.</p>
                <p>In addition, we have also provided this picture for K = 5, 10, and 20 below. Compared to K = 2, the only information added are the lighting and reflection of the lighting on the sign. Actually, we think this is even worse because those lightings and reflections are not valuable information, and also, for example, in K = 5, the relection above the word "Security" even made it like a gourp of mess that's covering the word, which is the main information shown in this picture.</p>
