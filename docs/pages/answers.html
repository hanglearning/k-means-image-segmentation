            <h4>Q1. What did you find concerning the relationship between k and the size of the new image?</h4>
            <p><span style="color: red">Answer:</span> We found that as the value of K increases, the size of the new image increases.</p>
            <img src="img/size_with_K.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p>For example, for this grass and squirrel picture, we can clearly see the sizes of the new pictures corresponding to the K = 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 are 8KB, 300KB, 826KB, 1.5M and 2MB. The same pattern applies to other pictures as well.</p>

            <h4>Q2. For each of your photos, which k is the best you think? Why?</h4>
            <p><span style="color: red">Answer:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <img src="img/new_scenery_outside_library_K5.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom:10px">
                <p style="text-align: center">K = 5</p>
                <li>For the photo of the scenery, we think <span style="color: blue">K = 5</span> is the best based on the resulted picture. When we were leaving the library, we saw the sky with the cloud having the color blue and white, the land with grass, tree and the little path haivng the color green and red, and the parking lot with the cars formulating another main part of the picture basically having a grey color. So the main 5 base colors for this picture are blue, white, green, red and grey. We took this picture and expected K = 5, and the resulted picture verified our speculation.<br> For K = 2, the picture is single tone and cannot reflect the beauty of the scenery. For K = 10, there are more details added to the picture and the color becomes richer, such as the white color of the path is actually a little bit yellow, rather than the same white that the cloud has, but that doesn't help reflecting the main information of this picture. For K = 20, if we look at this picture thumbnail, then it almost has no difference with K = 10, so K = 20 is not so much better than K = 10.</li>

                <img src="img/new_selfie_K10.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom:10px">
                <p style="text-align: center">K = 10</p>
                <li>For the photo of our selfie, we think <span style="color: blue">K = 10</span> is the best, because in K = 10 photo the main information converyed from this image, such as the colors of our clothes, the skin tone of our happy faces and the backgroud are sufficient to express our dressing, emotion and the place we took the selfie, which are the main ideas that are expressed inside of the original photo. While in K = 5 photo, our skin tone look pale and the colors are haploid, which will not tell how happy and energetic we are in the selfie. While for K = 20, although the representability of this picture is better then K = 10 in prespective of the colors, it is trivial to express the main ideas in this photo.</li>

                <img src="img/new_grass_and_squirrel_K20.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom:10px">
                <p style="text-align: center">K = 20</p>
                <li>For the photo of the grass and squirrel, we actually think no K is better than the other, because under each K (except K = 1), they all depict both grass and the squirrel as green, but in the original photo, the tree stump and the squirrel are brown. The only difference among each K is just more details are drawn as K increases, or say the photo becomes more sharp and clear. One may argue that K = 20 is the best for this photo since there's somehow brown color relected on both the squirrel and the tree stump. That's fine, since the answer could be objective, but after discussion, our group still maintains the thought that that brown color originated from the original photo is still recalculated as some sort of "heavy green" based on a green center. The main color of those two brown objects are still green.<br><br> When we took this photo, <span style="color: blue">originally we thought K = 2 should be the best for this photo</span>, since there are two base colors in this photo - brown as the squirrel and tree stump and green as the grass, but when we run our algorithm we realized that the initial pixel centers were picked randomly in the photo. As most part of this photo is green and the resolution of this photo is large(taken by a 12.2 MP camera on Pixel 3), there's high probability that the initial pixel centers would fall into the green regions, since the K values we selected are comparatively tiny compared to the resolution of the photo. If we stipulate that the pixel values of our initial picked centers must be very far from each other(under the context of their Euclid distances, in our case the centers could be green and brown),  then we may argue that K = 2 or K = 5 would be the best K value for this photo.</li>
